# Gripper

##  Abstract
This project focuses on designing and implementing a robotic gripper for a robotic arm. The gripper is capable of handling objects with precision and reliability using a compact and efficient mechanism. The system integrates **mechanical design**, **electronics**, and **software programming** to control the gripper using an **Arduino Uno** and **servo motors**. The implementation demonstrates a complete hardware-software integration for smooth and controlled gripping actions suitable for robotics applications.
